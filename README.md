# My Personal Website

I have consumed my first year for web development. This website was idea from the developers 
of the multi-national companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook. Also, seniors referred to have a 
website or domain of our own which will give impact to the recruiters.  This site has been built with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap 4. 
As I was beginner at JavaScript and jQuery, I tried to do maximum animation and effects 
in the website. I have also made the website responsive so that we can also see it on 
the mobile phones. Unfortunately, many things on website are hidden in the responsive layout.  I enjoyed while designing this website and during the meantime, I have also seen websites of frontend developers that was trending for designs, the websites was so interactive that I thought
frontend be plan B for my career.
